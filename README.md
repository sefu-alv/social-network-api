# Social Network API :iphone:

## Description  :memo:
This is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Users can create an account, add other users to their friend list, and post their thoughts. They can also react to their friends' thoughts and see a list of all the thoughts they and their friends have posted.

The API is built with `Node.js` and `Express.js`, and it uses `MongoDB` as the database and `Mongoose` as the ORM. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, with separate models for users and thoughts, and controllers that handle the business logic for each route.

The API provides a number of different endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. It uses middleware functions for error handling and validating data.
